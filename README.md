Problem Framing
Most classrooms do not have a lecture capture system. Even if it is installed, only
very few classes and instructors use it. At the same time, we found that lecture
videos are not presented in a way that best assists students’ learning process. To
find a certain point covered in class, students might need to sieve through the video
and type the point word by word into their notes. This is time-consuming and the
students may therefore miss important content. Hence, in order to maximise
students’ learning and help them to improve learning effectiveness, we made this
project.

Solution
Firstly, as the pace of the classes is fast, it is hard to type down all the key points into
their notes. Our app will provide a way to help students take notes easier. At the
same time, we added a support search function in order to decrease the time that
they waste to find certain topics covered in class.
Our main idea is to transcribe every word the instructor said and written on the
whiteboard into texts using state-of-the-art technologies. By transcribing handwriting
and speech into text, we can support search function and make it possible for
students to directly copy texts into their notes, and therefore provide students with an
interactive, convenient and engaging learning experience.
